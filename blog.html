                    <h2>MARCH 1st, 2023</h2>
                    <p>We got a sh*t ton of snow yesterday. Some people might think winter is overrated, but I think winter is my favorite season of the year. There's something about the snow that just puts me in a feeling I can't describe. Maverick loves the snow, too! Truly a winter wonderland. Also, I found out how to fix the wrapper animation overlapping the navbar when you scroll. Also also, I added a cool translateY animation when you open up the website. That's all you need to know.</p>

                    <p>Hello? Is anyone there? Hello? Anyways, this website is now live. I've been wanting to have a website of my own for quite some time now. Back then, I made websites with Google Sites, but a few years later, I figured that coding one in HTML and CSS was the better option. I coded one in September 2022, but then lost motivation. Finally, a few months later, I decided to get back to coding and start over. This time, I had motivation to finish this project. A lot of times, I seem to lose every single ounce of motivation in my projects. Especially with Sparta remixes. I think this website looks amazing for now. Though, there is one thing I do not know how to fix here. Oh well, I'm just gonna keep it this way. That's it for now.</p>
